It iterates through each element of the list of tasks until it finds a task with the specified ID or reaches the end of the list. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of tasks in the list. This means that the time taken to search for a task increases linearly with the number of tasks in the list.\n",

This is because the function iterates over each team member in the list until it finds a match for the provided member_id or reaches the end of the list. Therefore, the worst-case scenario occurs when the provided member_id is not in the list and the function has to iterate through all the team members, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).\n",

    "binary_search_task:The computational complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. In this implementation, the algorithm first checks if the list is empty or if there is only one element in the list. If there is only one element and it matches the target ID, the search is successful in constant time O(1). Otherwise, the algorithm initializes the left and right indices and enters a while loop, which runs until the left and right indices converge. Within the loop, the algorithm computes the mid index and compares the target ID with the ID of the element at the mid index. If the target ID is found, the search is successful in constant time O(1). If the target ID is less than the ID at the mid index, the right index is shifted to mid-1, and the search continues in the left half of the list. Similarly, if the target ID is greater than the ID at the mid index, the left index is shifted to mid+1, and the search continues in the right half of the list. Since each iteration of the loop divides the search space in half, the maximum number of iterations required to find the target ID is log2(n). Therefore, the computational complexity of this binary search implementation is O(log n).\n",

This is because at each step of the search, the algorithm divides the search space in half, reducing the number of possible options by half until the item is found or the search space is exhausted. In the worst case, this algorithm will take log base 2 of n comparisons to find the item. This is a more efficient algorithm than linear search, especially for large lists, as it requires fewer comparisons to find the desired item.\n",

    "In this implementation, we have two nested loops, where the outer loop iterates n-1 times and the inner loop iterates n-i-1 times in each iteration of the outer loop. Therefore, the total number of comparisons is (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1 = n*(n-1)/2, which is O(n^2). The number of swaps in the best and worst case is also O(n^2), since in the worst case we swap every element in the list n-1 times, and in the best case, we swap zero times. Overall, the computational complexity of this bubble sort implementation is O(n^2).\n",

    "The computational complexity of the quick_sort_project_by_start_date function can be expressed as O(n log n), where n is the number of projects in the input list.\n",
    "The function uses a recursive approach to sort the projects by start date using the quicksort algorithm. In the best-case scenario, the pivot element divides the input list into two approximately equal parts, leading to a time complexity of O(n log n). However, in the worst case, when the pivot element is chosen as the smallest or largest element in the list, the function degenerates into O(n^2).\n",
    "Overall, quicksort is an efficient algorithm for sorting large datasets, and it is often faster than other sorting algorithms such as bubble sort and selection sort."
